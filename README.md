📍 mapDemo – Interactive Map Marker Management App (Swift + MapKit)
mapDemo is an iOS application developed in Swift that allows users to interactively add, view, and manage custom location markers (annotations) on an Apple Map using MapKit. The project is a simple yet powerful demonstration of real-time map interaction, data persistence, and state management within a UIKit-based iOS app.

✨ Features
✅ Tap to Add Marker: Users can long-press or tap on any location on the Apple Map to drop a new marker (annotation).

📌 Custom Annotations: Each marker appears as a custom annotation on the map, making it easy to identify saved points of interest.

🗂 View All Markers: A dedicated screen displays a list of all saved markers, including their coordinates or custom names.

❌ Delete Markers: Users can delete any marker from the list, and the change is reflected immediately on the map.

🧠 State Management: The app keeps track of the marker data, ensuring that changes (add/delete) are consistently handled across different views.

🍏 Powered by MapKit: Utilizes Apple’s native MapKit framework for a seamless and performant mapping experience.
